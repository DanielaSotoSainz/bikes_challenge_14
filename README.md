#### Challenge 14: Module 14

# Overview of the Project

## Purpose of Bike Trip Analysis

During Module 14, a new software was implemented “Tableau”, it was useful to create different visualizations of the obtained data. The challenge consisted in the creation of multiple graphs to show the investors why a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a business. The proposal for the investors needs to show all the data in different graphs and analysis, creating important relations and a solid conclusion.
For the creation of the visualizations, it is important to convert some data in a specific format. In this case, the integer in “tripduration” was changed to a datetime datatype, using Pandas. The formated data was useful to create different graphs showing the number of bikes used, the date when people ride, how far they go and who rode the bike.


# Results

The next graphs were created during the module and challenge to visualize the data of bike rides.

* Checkout Times for User

The first graph in Image 1. represents the number of bikes used in each hour. In this case, most of the riders tend to ride less than an hour. The pick shown at the beginning of the plot tells that between the first 7-10 minutes of the first hour, most users checkout the bike.

* Checkout Times by Gender

The same graph from Image 1. was created for Image 2., but in this case a gender filter was added. The orange plot represents male users, the blue one is for females and the red one for known users. It can be said that most of the users that checkout the bikes are males, and that there is a big difference between the number of female riders and the number of male riders that checkout the bikes.

* Trips by Weekday

The other graph created for the challenge was to visualize the trip during the week. The graph is in Image 3., where the darker squares represent that in those times there are more users starting their bike ride. In this case, during Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm most of the users use the bike. Another important fact is that between 12 am and 5 am the number of riders starting their trips is quite small.

* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The next graph is located in Image 4. shows the same results like in the last one, but in this case the results are separated by gender. As it had been said, most of the users are males. The visualization also shows that females and males use the bikes at the same. It doesn’t matter the gender, all have the same behavior.

* Trips by Gender (Weekday)

The last graph created for the challenge shows the same results as in the last ones. The differences between Image 5. and the other two graphs are that the results are divided in customers and subscribers, and also that the graph shows how many users use the bikes during the week. The data can tell the gender of the subscriber. From the graph can be concluded that most of the users are subscribers and males. Also, it can be concluded that the day with most users is Thursday.

*Other Visualizations 

Some extra graphs created during the module appear in Image 6. The image includes a dashboard with different graphs. The pie chart shows the Genders, and the number above represents the total number of rides. The next graph, “Average Trip Duration”, shows the age of the users and tells which users last longer on the bike. In this case, riders borned in 1890 are the ones that have longer trip durations. The graph below the others represents the places where users start their ride. It shows in a map the place where most of the users start and also other places with less users.

# Summary

* Tableau Story

The Story created for the Challenge contains “Image 1. Checkout Times for User” and “Image 2. Checkout Times for Gender”. Both graphs were selected for the story to show the portion of the total users that are in FEMALE, MALE, and KNOWN groups.
